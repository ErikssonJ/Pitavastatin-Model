The presented PBPK model adequately describes the intravenous and oral pharmacokinetics of pitavastatin in adults. Discrepancies between model output and observed data can be assigned to the high interstudy variability in the PK of pitavastatin. This variability is probably due to the genetic polymorphism in SLCO1B1 (OATP1B1), which was investigated by the verification data set obtained from Ieiri et al. 2007, where the PK profiles of pitavastatin were measured in subjects with different polymorphism  ([Ieiri 2007](#5-references)). By applying different `kcat` values in the model, the difference in PK could be described [Section 3.3](#33-concentration-time-profiles).
